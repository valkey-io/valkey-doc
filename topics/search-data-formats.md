title: "Valkey Search - Data Formats"
description: Valkey Search Module Formats for Input Field Data
---

This document describes the data formats accepted by the search module for each field type during ingestion (when keys are created or modified) and how those values are processed before being stored in the index.

# Tag Fields

For both HASH and JSON index types, the incoming data for a tag field is a single UTF-8 string. A tag field can contain one or more tag values within a single string.

## Tag Ingestion

On ingestion, the input string is split using the declared `SEPARATOR` character into individual tags. The default separator is `,` (comma). A different separator can be specified when the field is declared with [`FT.CREATE`](../commands/ft.create.md):

```
FT.CREATE idx SCHEMA color TAG SEPARATOR "|"
```

The valid separator characters are: `,.<>{}[]"':;!@#$%^&*()-+=~`

After splitting, each tag is processed as follows:

1. Leading and trailing ASCII whitespace is stripped from each tag.
2. Empty tags (those that are empty or whitespace only after trimming) are silently discarded.
3. Duplicate tags within a single field value are deduplicated.

If the field value produces no valid tags after processing, the key is tracked but not indexed for that field.

### Case Sensitivity

By default, tag matching is case-insensitive. The `CASESENSITIVE` option on `FT.CREATE` changes this behavior:

```
FT.CREATE idx SCHEMA color TAG CASESENSITIVE
```

When `CASESENSITIVE` is not set, tags like `"Blue"` and `"blue"` are treated as equivalent during search. When `CASESENSITIVE` is set, they are treated as distinct values.

### Ingestion Separator vs. Query Separator

The separator specified in `FT.CREATE` applies only during data ingestion. In query expressions (`FT.SEARCH`), the separator between tags is always `|` (pipe), regardless of the ingestion separator. See the [query documentation](search-query.md#tag-match) for details.

## Examples of Tag Values

Given `FT.CREATE idx SCHEMA color TAG` (default separator `,`):

```
HSET doc:1 color "blue"                       --> tags: {"blue"}
HSET doc:2 color "blue,red"                   --> tags: {"blue", "red"}
HSET doc:3 color " blue , red "               --> tags: {"blue", "red"}
HSET doc:4 color "blue,,red"                  --> tags: {"blue", "red"}
HSET doc:5 color "hello world, green is nice" --> tags: {"hello world", "green is nice"}
HSET doc:6 color "  "                         --> no tags (key is untracked)
```

Note that spaces within a tag are preserved. In the example above, `"hello world"` is a single tag containing a space.

Given `FT.CREATE idx SCHEMA skills TAG SEPARATOR "|"`:

```
HSET doc:1 skills "python|java|go"    --> tags: {"python", "java", "go"}
HSET doc:2 skills "python | java"     --> tags: {"python", "java"}
```

# Numeric Fields

A numeric field contains a single number. On ingestion, the field value is parsed as a 64-bit IEEE 754 double-precision floating-point number.

## Accepted Formats

The following formats are accepted on ingestion:

- **Integers**: `"42"`, `"-100"`, `"0"`
- **Floating-point**: `"3.14"`, `"-0.5"`, `"2.0"`
- **Scientific notation**: `"1e2"`, `"3.14e-5"`
- **Positive infinity**: `"inf"`, `"Inf"`, `"+inf"`
- **Negative infinity**: `"-inf"`, `"-Inf"`

The following are rejected:

- **NaN**: `"nan"`, `"NaN"`, `"NAN"` -- explicitly rejected on ingestion.
- **Non-numeric strings**: `"hello"`, `""` -- the key becomes untracked for this field.

When a value is rejected, the key is not indexed for that field. This is not treated as an error; the key simply does not appear in numeric range queries.

## Precision and Range

All numeric values are stored internally as 64-bit double-precision floating-point numbers:

- **Range**: approximately +/-1.7976931348623157 x 10^308
- **Integer precision**: integers up to 2^53 (9,007,199,254,740,992) are represented exactly; larger integers may lose precision.
- **Decimal precision**: approximately 15-17 significant decimal digits.

## Examples of Numeric Values

```
HSET product:1 price "999.99"     --> stored as 999.99
HSET product:2 price "42"         --> stored as 42.0
HSET product:3 price "-100"       --> stored as -100.0
HSET product:4 price "1e2"        --> stored as 100.0
HSET product:5 price "inf"        --> stored as +infinity
HSET product:6 price "nan"        --> rejected (key untracked for this field)
HSET product:7 price "hello"      --> rejected (key untracked for this field)
```

See the [query documentation](search-query.md#numeric-range-match) for details on querying numeric ranges.

# Vector Fields

A vector field contains a fixed-length array of floating-point numbers. The data format differs between HASH and JSON index types.

## Supported Data Types

Three element types are supported. All are little-endian and all work with every
distance metric; they differ only in how many bytes each element occupies and how
much precision it retains.

| `TYPE` | Bytes per element | sign / exponent / mantissa bits | Largest finite magnitude | Approx. decimal digits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `FLOAT32` | 4 | 1 / 8 / 23 | ~3.4e38 | ~7 |
| `FLOAT16` | 2 | 1 / 5 / 10 | 65504 | ~3 |
| `BFLOAT16` | 2 | 1 / 8 / 7 | ~3.4e38 | ~2 |

`FLOAT16` and `BFLOAT16` both halve the memory a vector occupies compared with
`FLOAT32`. They differ in how they spend their 16 bits. `FLOAT16` keeps more
mantissa, so it is more precise, but its exponent range is much smaller: values
above 65504 in magnitude overflow to infinity. `BFLOAT16` is simply the top 16
bits of a `FLOAT32`, so it keeps the full `FLOAT32` exponent range and trades
away precision instead.

As a rule of thumb, embeddings that are normalized or otherwise bounded suit
`FLOAT16`, while data with a wide dynamic range suits `BFLOAT16`.

Choosing a 2-byte type is lossy: each element is rounded to the target type when
it is ingested, and the rounded value is what the index stores and compares. Recall
may therefore differ slightly from the same data indexed as `FLOAT32`.

The data type is specified as a required parameter in the [`FT.CREATE`](../commands/ft.create.md) command, and is reported back by [`FT.INFO`](../commands/ft.info.md) as the attribute's `data_type`:

```
FT.CREATE idx SCHEMA embedding VECTOR HNSW 6 TYPE FLOAT16 DIM 3 DISTANCE_METRIC L2
```

### Version requirement

An index schema that declares `FLOAT16` or `BFLOAT16` records a minimum module
version of 1.3.0. A module older than that refuses to load such an index rather
than misreading its 2-byte elements as `FLOAT32`. This matters when downgrading,
and in mixed-version clusters: keep to `FLOAT32` if an index has to be readable
by modules earlier than 1.3.0. Indexes that use only `FLOAT32` are unaffected.

### BFLOAT16 hardware requirement

`BFLOAT16` indexes require a CPU that provides a SIMD BF16 conversion path:
Haswell or newer on x86-64, or NEON-BF16/SVE-BF16 on ARM. On a CPU without one,
creating a `BFLOAT16` index -- or loading one from an RDB -- fails with an error
rather than producing incorrect distances. `FLOAT32` and `FLOAT16` indexes have
no such requirement.

## HASH Vector Format

For HASH-type indexes, vectors are stored as raw binary blobs. Each element is
written in little-endian byte order using the index's declared `TYPE`, so the
total blob size must be exactly `DIM * <bytes per element>`: `DIM * 4` for
`FLOAT32`, `DIM * 2` for `FLOAT16` and `BFLOAT16`.

The same 3-dimensional vector `[0.0, 0.0, 1.0]` in each type:

```
FLOAT32  (12 bytes)   \x00\x00\x00\x00  \x00\x00\x00\x00  \x00\x00\x80\x3f
FLOAT16  (6 bytes)    \x00\x00          \x00\x00          \x00\x3c
BFLOAT16 (6 bytes)    \x00\x00          \x00\x00          \x80\x3f
```

Note that the `BFLOAT16` encoding of 1.0 is the high half of the `FLOAT32`
encoding (`\x80\x3f`), which is what makes the conversion a truncation of the
top two bytes rather than a change of layout.

In Python, a HASH vector can be created with:

```python
import numpy as np

# FLOAT32
vector = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], dtype=np.float32).tobytes()

# FLOAT16
vector = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 1.0], dtype=np.float16).tobytes()

client.hset("doc:1", mapping={"embedding": vector})
```

Or equivalently with `struct`, whose format characters are `f` for `FLOAT32` and
`e` for `FLOAT16`:

```python
import struct
vector = struct.pack("<3f", 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)  # '<' = little-endian, 'f' = FLOAT32
vector = struct.pack("<3e", 0.0, 0.0, 1.0)  # 'e' = FLOAT16
```

Neither `numpy` nor `struct` has a native `BFLOAT16` type. Encode it by rounding
each `FLOAT32` to nearest-even and keeping the top two bytes:

```python
import struct

def to_bfloat16(values):
    packed = struct.pack(f"<{len(values)}f", *values)
    out = bytearray()
    for i in range(len(values)):
        u = int.from_bytes(packed[i * 4:i * 4 + 4], "little")
        u = (u + 0x7FFF + ((u >> 16) & 1)) & 0xFFFFFFFF  # round to nearest, ties to even
        out += u.to_bytes(4, "little")[2:4]              # keep the high half
    return bytes(out)

client.hset("doc:1", mapping={"embedding": to_bfloat16([0.0, 0.0, 1.0])})
```

The `ml_dtypes` package provides a `bfloat16` dtype usable with `numpy` if you
would rather not hand-roll the conversion.

If the blob size does not match the size implied by `DIM` and `TYPE`, the vector
is rejected and the key is not indexed for that field. A `FLOAT32`-encoded blob
supplied to a `FLOAT16` index is the common way to hit this: it is twice the
expected length.

## JSON Vector Format

For JSON type indexes, a vector may be written either as a **native JSON array**
of numbers or as a **JSON string** containing a bracketed, comma-separated list.
Both forms are supported and equivalent -- they index identically and return
identical distances:

```
JSON.SET doc:1 $ '{"embedding": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]}'     # native array
JSON.SET doc:2 $ '{"embedding": "[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"}'   # quoted string
```

Prefer the native array. It is ordinary JSON, so other readers of the document
see a real array rather than an opaque string, and it needs no client-side
formatting. The quoted string is the older form, still supported for documents
already written that way.

Either form is converted element by element to the index's declared `TYPE`. For
a `FLOAT16` or `BFLOAT16` index the values are therefore rounded to 2-byte
precision on ingest, exactly as a binary blob would be.

In Python, with the native array form:

```python
client.json().set("doc:1", "$", {"embedding": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]})
```

Or with the string form:

```python
vector = [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]
client.json().set("doc:2", "$",
                  {"embedding": "[" + ",".join(str(v) for v in vector) + "]"})
```

A value containing a non-numeric element, or whose element count does not match
`DIM`, is not indexed for that field: the key is left out of vector search
results, exactly as an incorrectly sized binary blob would be.

## Query Vectors

Regardless of whether the index is on HASH or JSON keys, query vectors provided
via `PARAMS` to `FT.SEARCH` must always use the binary blob format (the same
format as HASH vectors), encoded with the index's declared `TYPE`.

A query blob whose length does not match `DIM * <bytes per element>` is
rejected. Querying a 3-dimensional `FLOAT16` index with a `FLOAT32`-encoded blob,
for instance, returns:

```
Error parsing vector similarity parameters: query vector blob size (12) does not
match index's expected size (6).
```

## Examples of Vector Field Values

A 3-dimensional vector with HASH storage:

```
FT.CREATE idx ON HASH SCHEMA vec VECTOR FLAT 6 TYPE FLOAT32 DIM 3 DISTANCE_METRIC L2

HSET doc:1 vec "\x00\x00\x80?\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00\x00"
```

A 3-dimensional vector with JSON storage:

```
FT.CREATE idx ON JSON SCHEMA $.vec AS vec VECTOR FLAT 6 TYPE FLOAT32 DIM 3 DISTANCE_METRIC L2

JSON.SET doc:1 $ '{"vec": [1.0, 0.0, 0.0]}'
```

The same document using the string form, which is equivalent:

```
JSON.SET doc:1 $ '{"vec": "[1.0, 0.0, 0.0]"}'
```

The same vector in a `FLOAT16` index, where each element is 2 bytes rather than 4:

```
FT.CREATE idx ON HASH SCHEMA vec VECTOR FLAT 6 TYPE FLOAT16 DIM 3 DISTANCE_METRIC L2

HSET doc:1 vec "\x00\x3c\x00\x00\x00\x00"
```

# Text Fields

A text field contains a string of words. On ingestion, the raw string passes through a multi-stage processing pipeline to produce a sequence of searchable tokens.

## Text Ingestion

The pipeline consists of four stages applied in order:

1. **Lexical Analysis** -- split text into words
2. **Case Folding** -- convert to lowercase
3. **Stop Word Removal** -- filter out common words
4. **Stemming** -- reduce words to root forms

### Lexical Analysis

The input string is split into words based on punctuation characters and whitespace. A "word" is any contiguous sequence of characters that is not punctuation and not whitespace.

**Whitespace characters** always break words. This includes spaces, tabs, newlines, carriage returns, and control characters.

**Punctuation characters** are configurable. The default set is:

```
,.<>{}[]"':;!@#$%^&*()-+=~/\|
```

A custom punctuation set can be specified at index creation time:

```
FT.CREATE idx PUNCTUATION ",.!?" SCHEMA content TEXT
```

The punctuation set operates on individual bytes. Multi-byte UTF-8 characters (such as CJK characters or emoji) are not treated as punctuation and become part of the surrounding word.

**Escape sequences**: A backslash (`\`) before a punctuation character causes that character to be treated as part of the word rather than as a word boundary. For example, `hello\,world` produces the single token `hello,world`.

The input must be valid UTF-8. Invalid UTF-8 sequences cause the record to be rejected.

### Case Folding

After tokenization, each word is converted to lowercase. For ASCII text, this uses standard ASCII lowercasing. For text containing non-ASCII characters, Unicode case folding (via ICU) is applied.

### Stop Word Removal

Stop words are common words that are excluded from the index. The default stop word list for English is:

> a, an, and, are, as, at, be, but, by, for, if, in, into, is, it, no, not, of, on, or, such, that, their, then, there, these, they, this, to, was, will, with

Stop words can be customized at index creation time:

```
FT.CREATE idx STOPWORDS 2 the a SCHEMA content TEXT
FT.CREATE idx NOSTOPWORDS SCHEMA content TEXT
```

`NOSTOPWORDS` or `STOPWORDS 0` disables stop word removal entirely.

Removed stop words do not occupy a position in the token sequence. For example, `"the quick brown fox"` (where "the" is a stop word) produces positions: quick=0, brown=1, fox=2. This is relevant for phrase matching and proximity queries.

### Stemming

Stemming reduces words to their root form so that morphological variants match each other. For example, "running", "runs", and "run" all have the same stem: "run". The stemming algorithm is language-specific; currently only English (Snowball stemmer) is supported.

Stemming is controlled by these options:

- `LANGUAGE ENGLISH` (schema-level): Specifies the stemming language. Currently only `ENGLISH` is supported.
- `NOSTEM` (per-field): Disables stemming for a specific text field.
- `MINSTEMSIZE <size>` (schema-level): Words shorter than this length are not stemmed. The default is 4.

When stemming is enabled, the original word (not the stemmed form) is stored in the index. The stem mapping is recorded separately so that a search on a term expands to match all terms that share the same stem, as well as the stem itself.

## Text Ingestion Examples

### Lexical Processing Examples

Given the default punctuation set:

| Input             | Tokens                        |
| :---------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `"hello world"`   | `hello`, `world`              |
| `"hello, world!"` | `hello`, `world`              |
| `"it's a test"`   | `it`, `s`, `a`, `test`        |
| `"hello-world"`   | `hello`, `world`              |
| `"price: $100"`   | `price`, `100`                |
| `"hello\,world"`  | `hello,world` (escaped comma) |

### Stop Word Removal Example

Given the default stop word list and input `"the quick brown fox is not fast"`:

| Stage                   | Result                                              |
| :---------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------- |
| After tokenization      | `the`, `quick`, `brown`, `fox`, `is`, `not`, `fast` |
| After case folding      | `the`, `quick`, `brown`, `fox`, `is`, `not`, `fast` |
| After stop word removal | `quick`, `brown`, `fox`, `fast`                     |

The stop words `the`, `is`, and `not` are removed. The remaining words have positions 0 through 3.

### Stemming Example

Given English stemming with the default `MINSTEMSIZE` of 4 and input `"The Running Searches cat"`:

| Stage                   | Result                                               |
| :---------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------- |
| After tokenization      | `The`, `Running`, `Searches`, `cat`                  |
| After case folding      | `the`, `running`, `searches`, `cat`                  |
| After stop word removal | `running`, `searches`, `cat`                         |
| Indexed tokens          | `running` (position 0), `searches` (position 1), `cat` (position 2) |
| Stem mappings           | `run` -> {`running`}, `search` -> {`searches`}       |

The word `the` is removed as a stop word. The word `cat` (3 characters) is below the minimum stem size and is not stemmed. A search for `run` or `runs` will match `running` through the stem mapping.
