description: Valkey TLS support
---

SSL/TLS is supported by Valkey as an optional feature
that needs to be enabled at compile time.

## Getting Started

### Building

To build with TLS support you'll need OpenSSL development libraries (e.g.
`libssl-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).

Build Valkey with the following command:

```sh
make BUILD_TLS=yes
```

### Tests

To run Valkey test suite with TLS, you'll need TLS support for TCL (i.e.
`tcl-tls` package on Debian/Ubuntu).

1. Run `./utils/gen-test-certs.sh` to generate a root CA and a server
   certificate.

2. Run `./runtest --tls` or `./runtest-cluster --tls` to run Valkey and Valkey
   Cluster tests in TLS mode.

### Running manually

To manually run a Valkey server with TLS mode (assuming `gen-test-certs.sh` was
invoked so sample certificates/keys are available):

    ./src/valkey-server --tls-port 6379 --port 0 \
        --tls-cert-file ./tests/tls/valkey.crt \
        --tls-key-file ./tests/tls/valkey.key \
        --tls-ca-cert-file ./tests/tls/ca.crt

To connect to this Valkey server with `valkey-cli`:

    ./src/valkey-cli --tls \
        --cert ./tests/tls/valkey.crt \
        --key ./tests/tls/valkey.key \
        --cacert ./tests/tls/ca.crt

### Certificate configuration

In order to support TLS, Valkey must be configured with a X.509 certificate and a
private key. In addition, it is necessary to specify a CA certificate bundle
file or path to be used as a trusted root when validating certificates. To
support DH based ciphers, a DH params file can also be configured. For example:

```
tls-cert-file /path/to/valkey.crt
tls-key-file /path/to/valkey.key
tls-ca-cert-file /path/to/ca.crt
tls-dh-params-file /path/to/valkey.dh
```

### TLS listening port

The `tls-port` configuration directive enables accepting SSL/TLS connections on
the specified port. This is **in addition** to listening on `port` for TCP
connections, so it is possible to access Valkey on different ports using TLS and
non-TLS connections simultaneously.

You may specify `port 0` to disable the non-TLS port completely. To enable only
TLS on the default Valkey port, use:

```
port 0
tls-port 6379
```

### Client certificate authentication

By default, Valkey uses mutual TLS and requires clients to authenticate with a
valid certificate (authenticated against trusted root CAs specified by
`ca-cert-file` or `ca-cert-dir`).

You may use `tls-auth-clients no` to disable client authentication.

### Replication

A Valkey master server handles connecting clients and replica servers in the same
way, so the above `tls-port` and `tls-auth-clients` directives apply to
replication links as well.

On the replica server side, it is necessary to specify `tls-replication yes` to
use TLS for outgoing connections to the master.

### Cluster

When Valkey Cluster is used, use `tls-cluster yes` in order to enable TLS for the
cluster bus and cross-node connections.

### Sentinel

Sentinel inherits its networking configuration from the common Valkey
configuration, so all of the above applies to Sentinel as well.

When connecting to master servers, Sentinel will use the `tls-replication`
directive to determine if a TLS or non-TLS connection is required.

In addition, the very same `tls-replication` directive will determine whether Sentinel's
port, that accepts connections from other Sentinels, will support TLS as well. That is,
Sentinel will be configured with `tls-port` if and only if `tls-replication` is enabled. 

### Additional configuration

Additional TLS configuration is available to control the choice of TLS protocol
versions, ciphers and cipher suites, etc. Please consult the self documented
`valkey.conf` for more information.

### Performance considerations

TLS adds a layer to the communication stack with overheads due to writing/reading to/from an SSL connection, encryption/decryption and integrity checks. Consequently, using TLS results in a decrease of the achievable throughput per Valkey instance.

### Limitations

I/O threading is currently not supported with TLS.
