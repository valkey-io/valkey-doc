* Valkey is **open source software** released under the terms of the **three clause BSD license**. Most of the Valkey source code was written by Salvatore Sanfilippo and Pieter Noordhuis. A list of other contributors can be found in the git history.

* Valkey is based on the formerly open source Redis, as it was before the
  license of Redis was changed to one that is not open source.
  Read more about this in the [History of Valkey](history.md).
  Redis is a trademark of Redis Ltd. Whenever we use the name Redis in the
  Valkey documentation, we're trying our best to use it in accordance with the
  [Redis Trademark Guidelines](https://redis.com/legal/trademark-guidelines/).
