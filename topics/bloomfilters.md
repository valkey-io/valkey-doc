    Introduction to Bloom Filters
---

In Valkey, the bloom filter data type / commands are implemented in the [valkey-bloom module](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-bloom) which is an official valkey module compatible with versions 8.0 and above. Users will need to load this module onto their valkey server in order to use this feature.

Bloom filters are a space efficient probabilistic data structure that allows adding elements and checking whether elements exist. False positives are possible where a filter incorrectly indicates that an element exists, even though it was not added. However, Bloom Filters guarantee that false negatives (incorrectly indicating that an element does not exist, even though it was added) do not occur.

## Basic Bloom commands

* [`BF.ADD`](../commands/bf.add.md) - adds an item to a bloom filter
* [`BF.CARD`](../commands/bf.card.md) - returns the cardinality of a bloom filter
* [`BF.EXISTS`](../commands/bf.exists.md) - checks if an item has been added to a bloom filter
* [`BF.INFO`](../commands/bf.info.md) - returns information about a bloom filter

See the [complete list of bloom filter commands](../commands/#bloom).

## Common use cases for bloom filters

### Advertisement / Campaign placement and deduplication

Bloom filters can help e-commerce sites, streaming services, advertising networks, or marketing platforms answer the following questions:

* Has an advertisement already been shown to a user?
* Has a promotional email or notification already been sent to a user?
* Has a product already been purchased by a user?

Example: For each user, use a Bloom filter to store all the products they have purchased. The recommendation engine can then suggest a new product and check if it is present in the user's Bloom filter.

* If the product is not in the filter, the ad is shown to the user, and the product is added to the filter.
* If the product is already in the filter, it means the ad has already been shown to the user and the recommendation engine finds a different ad to show.

### Fraud detection

Bloom filters can be used to answer the question, "Has this card been flagged as stolen?". To do this, use a bloom filter that contains cards reported as stolen. When a card is used, check whether it is present in the bloom filter. If the card is not found, it means it is not marked as stolen. If the card is present in the filter, a check can be made against the main database, or the purchase can be denied.

### Filtering Spam / Harmful Content
Bloom filters provide an efficient way to screen content for potential threats and harmful material. Here's how they can be effectively used:

Example: Bloom filters can answer the question "is a URL malicious?". Any URL inputted would be checked against a malicious URL bloom filter. 

* If no, then we allow access to the site.
* If yes, then we can deny access or perform a full check of the URL.

Example: Bloom filters can answer the question is this content harmful or spam. Create a bloom filter that contains spam email addresses or spam phone numbers. When an email or text is received then check if the number or email is present in the bloom filter. 

* If no, then the message can be displayed to the user.
* If yes, then we can send the message to the spam folder or perform a full check on the email or number.

### Check if a username is taken

Bloom filters can answer the question: Has this username/email/domain name/slug already been used?

In this username example, we can use a Bloom filter to track every username that has signed up. When a new user attempts to sign up with their desired username, the app checks if the username exists in the Bloom filter.

* If no, the user is created and the username is added to the Bloom filter.
* If yes, the app can decide to either check the main database or reject the username.

## Tutorial

To use bloom filters with Valkey, you need to:

1. **Install Valkey**: Follow the [installation guides](installation.md) to install Valkey on your system.

2. **Get the valkey-bloom module**: You have three options:
   - Use the Docker image: [valkey-extensions](https://hub.docker.com/r/valkey/valkey-bundle)
   - Download a pre-built binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-bloom/releases)
   - Build from source by following the [build instructions](https://github.com/valkey-io/valkey-bloom/blob/unstable/README.md#build-instructions)

Once valkey-bloom is built, you can run the Valkey server with the module loaded in two different ways, on server start up:
```bash
./valkey-server --loadmodule ./target/release/libvalkey_bloom.so
```
You can also load the valkey bloom module on an already running server by running the following command in [valkey-cli](cli.md):
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> MODULE LOAD /path/to/libvalkey_bloom.so
```

### Usage example

* Create a bloom filter of taken usernames with a 1 in 1000 chance of false positives and 10000 initial capacity.
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.RESERVE usernames 0.001 10000
OK
```
* Add usernames which now have signed up to the bloom filters
```bash
# Add one user to the bloom filter
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.ADD usernames johnsmith
(integer) 1

# Add multiple users at once
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.MADD usernames JaneDoe valkeyFan bloomEnjoyer
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 1
3) (integer) 1
```

* Check if usernames have been taken already
```bash
# Check if as single user has been added
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.EXISTS usernames johnsmith
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.EXISTS usernames fake_user
(integer) 0

# Check if multiple users are present in the bloomfilter at once
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.MEXISTS usernames johnsmith fake_user JaneDoe
1) (integer) 1
2) (integer) 0
3) (integer) 1
```

* Get how many users have been created
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.CARD usernames
(integer) 4
```
* Get the information surrounding your bloom filter of users
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.INFO usernames
 1) Capacity
 2) (integer) 10000
 3) Size
 4) (integer) 23912
 5) Number of filters
 6) (integer) 1
 7) Number of items inserted
 8) (integer) 4
 9) Error rate
10) "0.001"
11) Expansion rate
12) (integer) 2
13) Tightening ratio
14) "0.5"
15) Max scaled capacity
16) (integer) 26214300
```
* If you want to limit the number of people who can sign up you can create a non scaling filter. This will create a filter than can only have 1000 items added with a 1 in 10,000 chance of a false positive.
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.RESERVE limited_users 0.00001 1000 NONSCALING
OK
```
* If you anticipate once initial users have signed up after a while you will get a large increase in users you can set a custom expansion rate.
```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.RESERVE expanding_users 0.001 10000 EXPANSION 4
OK
```

## Scaling and non scaling bloom filters

The bloom filter data type can act either as a "scaling bloom filter" or "non scaling bloom filter" depending on user configuration.

The difference between scaling and non scaling bloom filters is that scaling bloom filters do not have a fixed capacity, instead they can grow. Non-scaling bloom filters will have a fixed capacity, meaning only a fixed number of items can be inserted to it. Scaling bloom filters consist of a vector of "Sub filters" with length >= 1, while non scaling will only contain 1 sub filter.

When a scaling bloom filter reaches its capacity, adding a new unique item will trigger a scale out and a new sub filter is created and added to the vector of sub filters. This new sub filter will have a larger capacity (previous bloom filter's capacity * expansion rate of the bloom object).

After a non scaling bloom filter reaches its capacity, if a user tries to add a new unique item, an error will be returned

The expansion rate is the rate that a scaling bloom filter's capacity is increased by upon scale out. For example, we have a bloom filter with capacity 100 at creation with an expansion rate of 2. After adding 101 unique items, it will scale out and create a new sub filter with capacity 200. Then, after adding 200 more unique items (301 items total), a new sub filter of capacity 400 is added upon scale out and so on. 

### When should you use scaling vs non-scaling filters

If the capacity (number of items we want to add) is known and fixed, using a non-scaling bloom filter is preferred. Likewise the reverse case, if the capacity is unknown / dynamically calculated, using a scaling bloom filters is ideal.

There are a few benefits for using non scaling filters. A non scaling filter will have better performance than a filter that has scaled out several times (e.g. > 100). Also, non scaling filters in general use less memory for a scaling filter that has scaled out several times to hold the same capacity.

However, to ensure you do not hit any capacity related errors, and want use-as-you-go capacity, scaling is better.

## Bloom properties

* Capacity - The number of unique items that would need to be added before a scale out occurs or (non scaling) before it rejects addition of unique items. 

* False Positive Rate (Error rate) - The rate that controls the probability of bloom check/set operations being false positives. Example: An item addition returning 0 (or an item check returning 1) indicating that the item was already added even though it was not.

* Expansion - This is a property of scalable bloom filters which controls the growth in overall capacity when a bloom filter scales out by determining the capacity of the new sub filter which gets created. This new capacity is equal to the previous filters capacity * expansion rate 

### Advanced Properties

The following two properties can be specified in the `BF.INSERT` command:

* Seed -  This is the key with which hash functions are created for the bloom filter. In case of scalable bloom filters, the same seed is used across all sub filters. This property is only useful if you have a specific 32 byte seed that you want your bloom filter to use. By default every bloom filter will use a random seed.

* Tightening Ratio - This is a property of scalable bloom filters which controls the overall correctness of the bloom filter as it scales out by keeping the actual false positive rate closer to the user requested false positive rate when the bloom filter was created. This is done by using the tightening ratio to set a stricter false positive on the new sub filter which gets created during each scale out. We do not recommend fine tuning this unless there is a specific use case for lower memory usage with higher false positive or vice versa.

### Default bloom properties

These are the default bloom properties along with the commands and configs which allow customizing.

| Property | Default Value | Command Name | Configuration name |
|----------|--------------|--------------|-------------------|
| Capacity | 100 | BF.INSERT, BF.RESERVE | BF.BLOOM-CAPACITY |
| False Positive Rate | 0.01 | BF.INSERT, BF.RESERVE | BF.BLOOM-FP-RATE |
| Scaling / Non Scaling | Scaling | BF.INSERT, BF.RESERVE | BF.BLOOM-EXPANSION |
| Expansion Rate | 2 | BF.INSERT, BF.RESERVE | BF.BLOOM-EXPANSION |
| Tightening Ratio | 0.5 | BF.INSERT | BF.BLOOM-TIGHTENING-RATIO |
| Seed | Random Seed | BF.INSERT | BF.BLOOM-USE-RANDOM-SEED |


Since bloom filters have a default expansion of 2, this means any default creation as a result of `BF.ADD`, `BF.MADD`, `BF.INSERT` will be a scalable bloom filter. Users can create a non scaling bloom filter using `BF.RESERVE <filter-name> <error-rate> <capacity> NONSCALING` or by specifying `NONSCALING` in `BF.INSERT`. Additionally, the other default properties of a bloom filter creation can be seen in the table above and BF.INFO command response below. These default properties can be configured through configs on the bloom module.

Example of default bloom filter information:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.ADD default_filter item
1
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.INFO default_filter
 1) Capacity
 2) (integer) 100
 3) Size
 4) (integer) 384
 5) Number of filters
 6) (integer) 1
 7) Number of items inserted
 8) (integer) 2
 9) Error rate
10) "0.01"
11) Expansion rate
12) (integer) 2
13) Tightening ratio
14) "0.5"
15) Max scaled capacity
16) (integer) 26214300
```

### When to adjust default configurations

Adjusting the default configurations can be beneficial in several scenarios:

- **Higher capacity (bf.bloom-capacity)**: Increase this value when you expect to store many items in most of your bloom filters. This reduces the need for scaling operations which can improve performance.

- **Lower false positive rate (bf.bloom-fp-rate)**: Decrease this value when accuracy is critical for your application. For example, in fraud detection or security applications where false positives are costly.

- **Higher expansion rate (bf.bloom-expansion)**: Increase this value when you want faster growth of bloom filters that need to scale. This reduces the number of scaling operations but uses more memory quicker.

- **Lower tightening ratio (bf.bloom-tightening-ratio)**: Adjust this when you want to maintain a more consistent false positive rate across multiple scaling operations. (Not advisable to change this default)

- **Random seed (bf.bloom-use-random-seed)**: Set to false only when you need deterministic behavior for testing or reproducibility.

You can modify these default values using the CONFIG SET command:

Example usage of changing all the different properties:
```bash
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-fp-rate 0.001
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-capacity 1000
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-expansion 4
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-tightening-ratio 0.6
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-use-random-seed false
```

### Memory usage limit

The `bf.bloom-memory-usage-limit` configuration (default 128MB) controls the maximum memory that a single bloom filter can use:

Example usage of increasing the limit:
```bash
CONFIG SET bf.bloom-memory-usage-limit 256mb
```

This setting is particularly important for production environments for several reasons:

- **Resource protection**: Prevents a single bloom filter from consuming excessive memory
- **Denial of service prevention**: Protects against attacks that might try to create enormous filters
- **Predictable scaling**: Ensures bloom filters have a known upper bound on resource usage

If your use case requires exceptionally large bloom filters, you can increase this limit. However, be aware that very large bloom filters might impact overall system performance and memory availability for other operations.

When a bloom filter reaches this memory limit, any operation that would cause it to exceed the limit will fail with an error message indicating that the memory limit would be exceeded.

## Performance

The bloom commands which involve adding items or checking the existence of items have a time complexity of O(N * K) where N is the number of hash functions used by the bloom filter and K is the number of elements being inserted. This means that both BF.ADD and BF.EXISTS are both O(N) as they only operate on one item.

In case of scalable bloom filters, with every scale out, we increase the number of checks (using hash functions of each sub filter) performed during any add / exists operation. For this reason, it is recommended that users choose a capacity and expansion rate after evaluating the use case / workload to avoid several scale outs and reduce the number of checks.

The other bloom filter commands are O(1) time complexity: BF.CARD, BF.INFO, BF.RESERVE, and BF.INSERT (when no items are provided).

## Monitoring 

To check the server's overall bloom filter metrics, you can use the `INFO BF` or the `INFO MODULES` command. 

Example of `INFO BF` calls in different scenarios:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> INFO BF
# bf_bloom_core_metrics
bf_bloom_total_memory_bytes:0
bf_bloom_num_objects:0
bf_bloom_num_filters_across_objects:0
bf_bloom_num_items_across_objects:0
bf_bloom_capacity_across_objects:0

# bf_bloom_defrag_metrics
bf_bloom_defrag_hits:0
bf_bloom_defrag_misses:0
127.0.0.1:6379> bf.add key value
(integer) 1
127.0.0.1:6379> info bf
# bf_bloom_core_metrics
bf_bloom_total_memory_bytes:384
bf_bloom_num_objects:1
bf_bloom_num_filters_across_objects:1
bf_bloom_num_items_across_objects:1
bf_bloom_capacity_across_objects:100

# bf_bloom_defrag_metrics
bf_bloom_defrag_hits:0
bf_bloom_defrag_misses:0
```

### Bloom filter core metrics

* `bf_bloom_total_memory_bytes`: Current total number of bytes used by all bloom filters.

* `bf_bloom_num_objects`: Current total number of bloom filters.

* `bf_bloom_num_filters_across_objects`: Current total number of sub filters across all bloom filters.

* `bf_bloom_num_items_across_objects`: Current total number of items across all bloom filters.

* `bf_bloom_capacity_across_objects`: Current total capacity across all bloom filters.

### Bloom filter defrag metrics

* `bf_bloom_defrag_hits`: Total number of defrag hits that have occurred on bloom filters.

* `bf_bloom_defrag_misses`: Total number of defrag misses that have occurred on bloom filters.

## Handling Large Bloom Filters

There are two notable validations bloom filters faces.

1. Memory Usage:

    The memory usage limit per bloom filter by default is defined by the `BF.BLOOM-MEMORY-USAGE-LIMIT` module configuration which has a default value of 128 MB. If a command results in a creation / scale out causing the overall memory usage to exceed this limit, the command is rejected. This config is modifiable and can be increased as needed.

2. Number of sub filters (in case of scalable bloom filters):

    When a bloom filter scales out, a new sub filter is added. The limit on the number of sub filters depends on the false positive rate and tightening ratio. Each sub filter has a stricter false positive, and this is controlled by the tightening ratio. If a command attempting a scale out results in the sub filter reaching a false positive of 0, the command is rejected. 


You can use `VALIDATESCALETO` as an optional arg of `BF.INSERT` to help determine whether the bloom filter can scale out to the reach the specified capacity without hitting either limits mentioned above. It will reject the command otherwise.

As seen below, when trying to create a bloom filter with a capacity that cannot be achieved through scale outs (given the memory limits), the command is rejected. However, if the capacity can be achieved through scale out (even with the limits), then the creation of the bloom filter will succeed.

Example:

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.INSERT validate_scale_fail VALIDATESCALETO 26214301
(error) ERR provided VALIDATESCALETO causes bloom object to exceed memory limit
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.INSERT validate_scale_valid VALIDATESCALETO 26214300
[]
```

The `BF.INFO` command's `MAXSCALEDCAPACITY` field can be used to find out the maximum capacity that the scalable bloom filter can expand to hold.

```bash
127.0.0.1:6379> BF.INFO validate_scale_valid MAXSCALEDCAPACITY
(integer) 26214300
```

The `BF.INFO` command's `SIZE` field can be used to find out the current size of a bloom filter.

```bash
172.31.45.25:6379> BF.INFO validate_scale_valid SIZE
(integer) 384
```
