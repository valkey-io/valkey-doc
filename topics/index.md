# Valkey Documentation
## 1. Introduction
   
* What is Valkey? See [Introduction](introduction.md).
* [Quick start](quickstart.md): Get started with Valkey.
* [Valkey Bundle](valkey-bundle.md): Get started with Valkey Bundle.
* [FAQ](faq.md): Frequently asked questions.

## 2. Developer Guide
### Core Concepts
* [Data types](data-types.md): Keys are strings, but values can be of many different data types.
* [The full list of commands](../commands/), with documentation for each of them.
* [Pipelining](pipelining.md): How to send multiple commands at once, saving on round trip time.
* [Transactions](transactions.md): Valkey's approach to atomic transactions.
* [Expires](../commands/expire.md): How to set a Time To Live (TTL) on key so that it will be automatically removed from the server when it expires.
* [Pub/Sub](pubsub.md): Using Valkey as a message broker using the Publish/Subscribe messaging system.
* [Keyspace notifications](notifications.md): Get notifications of keyspace events via Pub/Sub.
* [Keyspace management](keyspace.md): How to alter, query, and navigate the keyspace.

### Application Patterns & Tutorials

* [Valkey as an LRU cache](lru-cache.md): How to configure Valkey as a cache with a fixed amount of memory and automatic eviction of keys.
* [Client side caching](client-side-caching.md): How a client can be notified by the server when a key has changed.
* [Distributed locks](distlock.md): Implementing a distributed lock manager.
* [Secondary indexes](indexing.md): How to simulate secondary indexes, composed indexes and traverse graphs using various data structures.
* [Writing a simple Twitter clone with PHP and Valkey](twitter-clone.md)

## 3. Extending Valkey

### Server-side scripting in Valkey
* [Programmability overview](programmability.md): An overview of programmability in Valkey.
* [Introduction to Eval Scripts](eval-intro.md): An introduction about using cached scripts.
