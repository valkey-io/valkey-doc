When all the elements in a sorted set are inserted with the same score, in order to force lexicographical ordering, this command removes all elements in the sorted set stored at `key` between the lexicographical range specified by `min` and `max`.

The meaning of `min` and `max` are the same of the `ZRANGEBYLEX` command. Similarly, this command actually removes the same elements that `ZRANGEBYLEX` would return if called with the same `min` and `max` arguments.

## Examples

```valkey-cli
127.0.0.1:6379> ZADD myzset 0 aaaa 0 b 0 c 0 d 0 e
(integer) 5
127.0.0.1:6379> ZADD myzset 0 foo 0 zap 0 zip 0 ALPHA 0 alpha
(integer) 5
127.0.0.1:6379> ZRANGE myzset 0 -1
 1) "ALPHA"
 2) "aaaa"
 3) "alpha"
 4) "b"
 5) "c"
 6) "d"
 7) "e"
 8) "foo"
 9) "zap"
10) "zip"
127.0.0.1:6379> ZREMRANGEBYLEX myzset [alpha [omega
(integer) 6
127.0.0.1:6379> ZRANGE myzset 0 -1
1) "ALPHA"
2) "aaaa"
3) "zap"
4) "zip"
```
