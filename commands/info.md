The `INFO` command returns information and statistics about the server in a
format that is simple to parse by computers and easy to read by humans.

The optional parameter can be used to select a specific section of information:

*   `server`: General information about the Valkey server
*   `clients`: Client connections section
*   `memory`: Memory consumption related information
*   `persistence`: RDB and AOF related information
*   `stats`: General statistics
*   `replication`: primary/replica replication information
*   `cpu`: CPU consumption statistics
*   `commandstats`: Valkey command statistics
*   `latencystats`: Valkey command latency percentile distribution statistics
*   `sentinel`: Valkey Sentinel section (only applicable to Sentinel instances)
*   `cluster`: Valkey Cluster section
*   `modules`: Modules section
*   `keyspace`: Database related statistics
*   `errorstats`: Valkey error statistics

It can also take the following values:

*   `all`: Return all sections (excluding module generated ones)
*   `default`: Return only the default set of sections
*   `everything`: Includes `all` and `modules`

When no parameter is provided, the `default` option is assumed.

## Notes

Please note depending on the version of Valkey some of the fields have been

*   `used_memory_human`: Human readable representation of previous value
*   `used_memory_rss`: Number of bytes that Valkey allocated as seen by the

     directive
*   `mem_fragmentation_ratio`: Ratio between `used_memory_rss` and `used_memory`.
    Note that this doesn't only includes fragmentation, but also other process overheads (see the `allocator_*` metrics), and also overheads like code, shared libraries, stack, etc.
*   `mem_fragmentation_bytes`: Delta between `used_memory_rss` and `used_memory`.
    Note that when the total fragmentation bytes is low (few megabytes), a high ratio (e.g. 1.5 and above) is not an indication of an issue.
*   `allocator_frag_ratio:`: Ratio between `allocator_active` and `allocator_allocated`. This is the true (external) fragmentation metric (not `mem_fragmentation_ratio`).
*   `allocator_frag_bytes` Delta between `allocator_active` and `allocator_allocated`. See note about `mem_fragmentation_bytes`.
*   `allocator_rss_ratio`: Ratio between `allocator_resident` and `allocator_active`. This usually indicates pages that the allocator can and probably will soon release back to the OS.
*   `allocator_rss_bytes`: Delta between `allocator_resident` and `allocator_active`
*   `rss_overhead_ratio`: Ratio between `used_memory_rss` (the process RSS) and `allocator_resident`. This includes RSS overheads that are not allocator or heap related.
*   `rss_overhead_bytes`: Delta between `used_memory_rss` (the process RSS) and `allocator_resident`
*   `allocator_allocated`: Total bytes allocated form the allocator, including internal-fragmentation. Normally the same as `used_memory`.
*   `allocator_active`: Total bytes in the allocator active pages, this includes external-fragmentation.
*   `allocator_resident`: Total bytes resident (RSS) in the allocator, this includes pages that can be released to the OS (by [`MEMORY PURGE`](memory-purge.md), or just waiting).
*   `allocator_muzzy`: Total bytes of 'muzzy' memory (RSS) in the allocator. Muzzy memory is memory that has been freed, but not yet fully returned to the operating system. It can be reused immediately when needed or reclaimed by the OS when system pressure increases.
*   `mem_not_counted_for_evict`: Used memory that's not counted for key eviction. This is basically transient replica and AOF buffers.
*   `mem_clients_slaves`: Memory used by replica clients - Replica buffers share memory with the replication backlog, so this field can show 0 when replicas don't trigger an increase of memory usage.
*   `mem_clients_normal`: Memory used by normal clients
*   `mem_cluster_links`: Memory used by links to peers on the cluster bus when cluster mode is enabled.
*   `mem_aof_buffer`: Transient memory used for AOF and AOF rewrite buffers
*   `mem_replication_backlog`: Memory used by replication backlog
*   `mem_total_replication_buffers`: Total memory consumed for replication buffers.
*   `mem_allocator`: Memory allocator, chosen at compile time.
*   `mem_overhead_db_hashtable_rehashing`: Temporary memory overhead of database dictionaries currently being rehashed - Added in 8.0.
*   `active_defrag_running`: When `activedefrag` is enabled, this indicates whether defragmentation is currently active, and the CPU percentage it intends to utilize.
*   `lazyfree_pending_objects`: The number of objects waiting to be freed (as a
     result of calling [`UNLINK`](unlink.md), or [`FLUSHDB`](flushdb.md) and [`FLUSHALL`](flushall.md) with the **ASYNC**
     option)
*   `lazyfreed_objects`: The number of objects that have been lazy freed.

Ideally, the `used_memory_rss` value should be only slightly higher than
`used_memory`.
When rss >> used, a large difference may mean there is (external) memory fragmentation, which can be evaluated by checking
`allocator_frag_ratio`, `allocator_frag_bytes`.
When used >> rss, it means part of Valkey memory has been swapped off by the
operating system: expect some significant latencies.

Because Valkey does not have control over how its allocations are mapped to
memory pages, high `used_memory_rss` is often the result of a spike in memory
usage.

When Valkey frees memory, the memory is given back to the allocator, and the
allocator may or may not give the memory back to the system. There may be
a discrepancy between the `used_memory` value and memory consumption as
reported by the operating system. It may be due to the fact memory has been
used and released by Valkey, but not given back to the system. The
`used_memory_peak` value is generally useful to check this point.

Additional introspective information about the server's memory can be obtained
by referring to the [`MEMORY STATS`](memory-stats.md) command and the [`MEMORY DOCTOR`](memory-doctor.md).

 including the number of calls that reached command execution (not rejected),
 the total CPU time consumed by these commands, the average CPU consumed
 per command execution, the number of rejected calls
 (errors prior command execution), and the number of failed calls
 (errors within the command execution).

For each command type, the following line is added:

 If you need to change the exported percentiles, use `CONFIG SET latency-tracking-info-percentiles "50.0 99.0 99.9"`.

 This section requires the extended latency monitoring feature to be enabled (by default it's enabled).
 If you need to enable it, use [`CONFIG SET latency-tracking yes`](config-set.md).

database.
The statistics are the number of keys, and the number of keys with an expiration.

For each database, the following line is added:

**A note about the word slave used in this man page**: If not for backward compatibility, the Valkey project no longer uses the words "master" and "slave". Unfortunately in the given commands these words are part of the protocol, so we'll be able to remove such occurrences only when this API will be naturally deprecated.

**Modules generated sections**: Starting with Valkey 6, modules can inject their info into the `INFO` command, these are excluded by default even when the `all` argument is provided (it will include a list of loaded modules but not their generated info fields). To get these you must use either the `modules` argument or `everything`.,
