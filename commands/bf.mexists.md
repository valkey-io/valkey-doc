Determines if the provided item/s have been added to a bloom filter previously.

A Bloom filter has two possible responses when you check if an item exists:

* 0 - The item definitely does not exist since with bloom filters, false negatives are not possible.

* 1 - The item exists with a given false positive (`fp`) percentage. There is an `fp` rate % chance that the item does not exist. You can create bloom filters with a more strict false positive rate as needed.
