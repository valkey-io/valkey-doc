Subscribes the client to the specified channels.

Once the client enters the subscribed state it is not supposed to issue any
other commands, except for additional `SUBSCRIBE`, [SSUBSCRIBE](ssubscribe.md), [PSUBSCRIBE](psubscribe.md), [UNSUBSCRIBE](unsubscribe.md), [SUNSUBSCRIBE](sunsubscribe.md), 
[PUNSUBSCRIBE](punsubscribe.md), [PING](ping.md), [RESET](reset.md) and [QUIT](quit.md) commands.
However, if RESP3 is used (see [HELLO](hello.md)) it is possible for a client to issue any commands while in subscribed state.

Note that [RESET](reset.md) can be called to exit subscribed state.

For more information, see [Pub/sub](../topics/pubsub.md).
