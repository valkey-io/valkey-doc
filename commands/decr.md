Decrements the number stored at `key` by one.
If the key does not exist, it is set to `0` before performing the operation.
An error is returned if the key contains a value of the wrong type or contains a
string that can not be represented as integer.
This operation is limited to **64 bit signed integers**.

See `INCR` for extra information on increment/decrement operations.

## Examples

```
127.0.0.1:6379> SET mykey "10"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> DECR mykey
(integer) 9
127.0.0.1:6379> SET mykey "234293482390480948029348230948"
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> DECR mykey
(error) ERR value is not an integer or out of range
