Computes the union of `numkeys` sorted sets given by the specified keys, and
stores the result in `destination`.
It is mandatory to provide the number of input keys (`numkeys`) before passing
the input keys and the other (optional) arguments.

By default, the resulting score of an element is the sum of its scores in the
sorted sets where it exists.

Using the `WEIGHTS` option, it is possible to specify a multiplication factor
for each input sorted set.
This means that the score of every element in every input sorted set is
multiplied by this factor before being passed to the aggregation function.
When `WEIGHTS` is not given, the multiplication factors default to `1`.

With the `AGGREGATE` option, it is possible to specify how the results of the
union are aggregated.
This option defaults to `SUM`, where the score of an element is summed across
the inputs where it exists.
When this option is set to either `MIN` or `MAX`, the resulting set will contain
the minimum or maximum score of an element across the inputs where it exists.

If `destination` already exists, it is overwritten.
