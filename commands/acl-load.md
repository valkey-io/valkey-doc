When Valkey is configured to use an ACL file (with the `aclfile` configuration
option), this command will reload the ACLs from the file, replacing all
the current ACL rules with the ones defined in the file. The command makes
sure to have an *all or nothing* behavior, that is:

* If every line in the file is valid, all the ACLs are loaded.
* If one or more line in the file is not valid, nothing is loaded, and the old ACL rules defined in the server memory continue to be used.

## Examples

```
127.0.0.1:6379> ACL LOAD
OK
```

```
127.0.0.1:6379> ACL LOAD
(error) ERR /tmp/foo:1: Unknown command or category name in ACL...
```
