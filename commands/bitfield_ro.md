Read-only variant of the [`BITFIELD`](bitfield.md) command.
It is similar to the original `BITFIELD` but only accepts `GET` subcommand and can safely be used in read-only replicas.

Since the original `BITFIELD` has `SET` and `INCRBY` options, it is technically flagged as a writing command in the Valkey command table.
For this reason, read-only replicas in a Valkey Cluster will redirect it to the master instance even if the connection is in read-only mode (see the [`READONLY`](readonly.md) command of Valkey Cluster).

See original `BITFIELD` for more details.
