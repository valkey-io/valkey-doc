Load a library to Valkey.

The command receives a single mandatory parameter which is the source code that implements the library.
The library payload must start with Shebang statement that provides a metadata about the library (like the engine to use and the library name).
Shebang format: `#!<engine name> name=<library name>`. Currently engine name must be `lua`.

For the Lua engine, the implementation should declare one or more entry points to the library with the [`server.register_function()` API](../topics/lua-api.md#server.register_function).
Once loaded, you can call the functions in the library with the [`FCALL`](fcall.md) (or [`FCALL_RO`](fcall_ro.md) when applicable) command.

When attempting to load a library with a name that already exists, the Valkey server returns an error.
The `REPLACE` modifier changes this behavior and overwrites the existing library with the new contents.

The command will return an error in the following circumstances:

* An invalid _engine-name_ was provided.
* The library's name already exists without the `REPLACE` modifier.
* A function in the library is created with a name that already exists in another library (even when `REPLACE` is specified).
* The engine failed in creating the library's functions (due to a compilation error, for example).
* No functions were declared by the library.

For more information please refer to [Introduction to Valkey Functions](../topics/functions-intro.md).

## Examples

The following example will create a library named `mylib` with a single function, `myfunc`, that returns the first argument it gets.

```
127.0.0.1:6379> FUNCTION LOAD "#!lua name=mylib \n server.register_function('myfunc', function(keys, args) return args[1] end)"
mylib
127.0.0.1:6379> FCALL myfunc 0 hello
"hello"
```
