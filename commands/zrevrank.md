Returns the rank of `member` in the sorted set stored at `key`, with the scores
ordered from high to low.
The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the highest
score has rank `0`.

The optional `WITHSCORE` argument supplements the command's reply with the score of the element returned.

Use `ZRANK` to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from low to
high.
