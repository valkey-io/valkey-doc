The `LATENCY LATEST` command reports the latest latency events logged.

Each reported event has the following fields:

* Event name.
* Unix timestamp of the latest latency spike for the event.
* Latest event latency in millisecond.
* All-time maximum latency for this event.
* Sum of the latencies recorded in the time series for this event, added in 8.1.
* The number of latency spikes recorded in the time series for this event, added in 8.1.

"All-time" means the maximum latency since the Valkey instance was
started, or the time that events were reset [`LATENCY RESET`](latency-reset.md).

## Examples

OK
(1.00s)
127.0.0.1:6379> debug sleep .25
OK
127.0.0.1:6379> latency latest
