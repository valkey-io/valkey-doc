Returns the rank of `member` in the sorted set stored at `key`, with the scores
ordered from low to high.
The rank (or index) is 0-based, which means that the member with the lowest
score has rank `0`.

The optional `WITHSCORE` argument supplements the command's reply with the score of the element returned.

Use `ZREVRANK` to get the rank of an element with the scores ordered from high
to low.
