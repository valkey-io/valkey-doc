This command is exactly like `XRANGE`, but with the notable difference of
returning the entries in reverse order, and also taking the start-end
range in reverse order: in `XREVRANGE` you need to state the *end* ID
and later the *start* ID, and the command will produce all the element
between (or exactly like) the two IDs, starting from the *end* side.

So for instance, to get all the elements from the higher ID to the lower
ID one could use:

    XREVRANGE somestream + -

Similarly to get just the last element added into the stream it is
enough to send:

    XREVRANGE somestream + - COUNT 1
