Removes and returns the last elements of the list stored at `key`.

By default, the command pops a single element from the end of the list.
When provided with the optional `count` argument, the reply will consist of up
to `count` elements, depending on the list's length.

## Examples

127.0.0.1:6379> RPOP mylist
"five"
127.0.0.1:6379> RPOP mylist 2
1) "four"
2) "three"
127.0.0.1:6379> LRANGE mylist 0 -1
