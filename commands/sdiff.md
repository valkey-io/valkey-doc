Returns the members of the set resulting from the difference between the first
set and all the successive sets.

For example:

```
key1 = {a,b,c,d}
key2 = {c}
key3 = {a,c,e}
SDIFF key1 key2 key3 = {b,d}
```

Keys that do not exist are considered to be empty sets.

## Examples

127.0.0.1:6379> SADD key1 "b"
