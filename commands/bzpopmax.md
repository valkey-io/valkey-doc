`BZPOPMAX` is the blocking variant of the sorted set `ZPOPMAX` primitive.

It is the blocking version because it blocks the connection when there are no
members to pop from any of the given sorted sets.
A member with the highest score is popped from first sorted set that is
non-empty, with the given keys being checked in the order that they are given.

The `timeout` argument is interpreted as a double value specifying the maximum
number of seconds to block. A timeout of zero can be used to block indefinitely.

See the [BZPOPMIN documentation][cb] for the exact semantics, since `BZPOPMAX`
is identical to `BZPOPMIN` with the only difference being that it pops members
with the highest scores instead of popping the ones with the lowest scores.
