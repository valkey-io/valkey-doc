Subscribes the client to the given patterns.

Supported glob-style patterns:

* `h?llo` subscribes to `hello`, `hallo` and `hxllo`
* `h*llo` subscribes to `hllo` and `heeeello`
* `h[ae]llo` subscribes to `hello` and `hallo,` but not `hillo`

Use `\` to escape special characters if you want to match them verbatim.

Once the client enters the subscribed state it is not supposed to issue any other commands, except for additional [SUBSCRIBE](subscribe.md), [SSUBSCRIBE](ssubscribe.md), `PSUBSCRIBE`, [UNSUBSCRIBE](unsubscribe.md), [SUNSUBSCRIBE](sunsubscribe.md), [PUNSUBSCRIBE](punsubscribe.md), [PING](ping.md), [RESET](reset.md) and [QUIT](quit.md) commands.
However, if RESP3 is used (see [HELLO](hello.md)) it is possible for a client to issue any commands while in subscribed state.

Note that [RESET](reset.md) can be called to exit subscribed state.
