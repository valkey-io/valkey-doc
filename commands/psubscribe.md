Subscribes the client to the given patterns.

Supported glob-style patterns:

* `h?llo` subscribes to `hello`, `hallo` and `hxllo`
* `h*llo` subscribes to `hllo` and `heeeello`
* `h[ae]llo` subscribes to `hello` and `hallo,` but not `hillo`

Use `\` to escape special characters if you want to match them verbatim.

Once the client enters the subscribed state it is not supposed to issue any other commands, except for additional [`SUBSCRIBE`](subscribe.md), [`SSUBSCRIBE`](ssubscribe.md), `PSUBSCRIBE`, [`UNSUBSCRIBE`](unsubscribe.md), [`SUNSUBSCRIBE`](sunsubscribe.md), [`PUNSUBSCRIBE`](punsubscribe.md), [`PING`](ping.md), [`RESET`](reset.md) and [`QUIT`](quit.md) commands.
However, if RESP3 is used (see [`HELLO`](hello.md)) it is possible for a client to issue any commands while in subscribed state.

Note that [`RESET`](reset.md) can be called to exit subscribed state.
