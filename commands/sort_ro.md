Read-only variant of the `SORT` command. It is exactly like the original `SORT` but refuses the `STORE` option and can safely be used in read-only replicas.

Since the original `SORT` has a `STORE` option it is technically flagged as a writing command in the Valkey command table. For this reason read-only replicas in a Valkey Cluster will redirect it to the primary instance even if the connection is in read-only mode (see the `READONLY` command of Valkey Cluster).

The `SORT_RO` variant was introduced in order to allow `SORT` behavior in read-only replicas without breaking compatibility on command flags.

See original `SORT` for more details.

## Examples

```
SORT_RO mylist BY weight_*->fieldname GET object_*->fieldname
```
