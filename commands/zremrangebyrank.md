Removes all elements in the sorted set stored at `key` with rank between `start`
and `stop`.
Both `start` and `stop` are `0` -based indexes with `0` being the element with
the lowest score.
These indexes can be negative numbers, where they indicate offsets starting at
the element with the highest score.
For example: `-1` is the element with the highest score, `-2` the element with
the second highest score and so forth.
